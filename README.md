# Joke_Recommendation_System
Implementing a Jokes Recommender Engine using Jokes dataset

In this project, we have implemented a joke recommendation system. We have used 73,421 users rated jokes dataset provided by Jester Research project under flagship of UC Berkeley Laboratory for Automation Science and Engineering to find correlations between users and jokes by learning from the previous viewing history of users and to provide recommendations for jokes which users would prefer to see most. We firstly implemented a neighborhood-based user user Collaborative Filtering method which was intuitive and based on like people rate alike. Secondly, we used a Content Filtering method where we used topic modeling approach to create the topics of the 100 jokes!!
